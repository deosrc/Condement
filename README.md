# Condement

Condement (or **Con**tainer **De**velopment Environ**ment**) is intended as a simple way to get a development environment for containers working.

This project was started due to various issues encountered while trying to develop Linux containers using Windows host. The project aims to provide a stable, easy to use development environment for Linux containers allowing developers to spend more time developing and less time setting up and maintaining their environments.

## The Result

The environment can be configure with a simple yaml file but as default you should end up with:

* Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) with various desktop options:
  * Xubuntu
  * Lubuntu
  * Ubuntu Budgie
* A 'dev' user with sudo (password: 'condement')
* Files persisted to your host machine
* Visual Studio Code
* Docker
* Kubernetes (via [k3s](http://k3s.io))

Comming soon should also be:

* Git
* Kubernetes Dashboard

## Prerequisites

In order to run this, you will need the following installed:

* VirtualBox
* Vagrant

## Configuration

A sample configuration file is provided in the root of the repository named [condement_sample.yaml](./condiment_sample.yaml) which include comments of what each configuration setting is for. This should be copied to `condement.yaml` and edited as required.

## Setup Instructions

Setup is easy. Just makes sure you have the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) installed, then do the following:

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. Copy `condement_sample.yaml` to `condement.yaml` and edit as required.
3. Open a command prompt in the directory
4. Run `vagrant up`

Once the Virtual Machine has finished building, you should be able to log in to the 'dev' account using the Ubuntu Desktop and the password 'condement'.
