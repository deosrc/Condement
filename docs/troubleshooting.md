# Troubleshooting

## The right control key isn't working

The right control key is the VirtualBox host key by default. This is used for VirtualBox commands such as enter/exit
full screen. You can change this key in the VirtualBox settings.

Options for connection via remote desktop are being considered to mitigate this.
