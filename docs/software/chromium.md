## Description

![chromium logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Chromium_Material_Icon.png/64px-Chromium_Material_Icon.png)

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

Source: [chromium.org](https://www.chromium.org/)

## Install Notes

Installed from Ubuntu official package repositories.

Condement will always install the latest version as chromium will auto-update.

## Limitations

* Persistent storage was non-functional. This may have been resolved with changes to host folder permissions but needs
  testing.
